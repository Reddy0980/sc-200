## Explanation
In Microsoft Sentinel, you can collect evidence from multiple data sources, including Azure Monitor logs and events. You can then correlate evidence to entities such as users and devices to understand the full scope of the incident. Azure Security Center and Azure Active Directory are not explicitly designed for collecting and correlating evidence for incident investigation.
