## Explanation
Microsoft Defender for Identity supports two types of sensors: network sensors and host sensors. Network sensors are deployed strategically and monitor network traffic, whereas host sensors are installed on individual devices and monitor device activities. A network sensor with port mirroring is a valid configuration for Microsoft Defender for Identity because it allows the sensor to monitor network traffic without disrupting network operations. Port mirroring involves duplicating the network traffic from a switch port and sending it to a monitoring device for analysis.
