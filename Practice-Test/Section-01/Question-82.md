## Explanation
To configure SOAR in Microsoft Sentinel, you can create custom rules and alerts that trigger automated incident handling. This involves configuring automation rules to take actions such as blocking malicious IP addresses or quarantining infected machines. Exporting the built-in playbooks is not an appropriate action as those playbooks are pre-configured for specific scenarios. Connecting third-party machine learning models can help to automate threat hunting, but it is not the primary action in configuring SOAR. Creating a backup of the incident handling process is essential, but it is not specific to configuring SOAR.
