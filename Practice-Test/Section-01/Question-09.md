## Explanation
An advanced hunting query is a powerful tool that allows you to filter and analyze vast amounts of data Microsoft Defender collects for Endpoint. You can use it to provide additional details about a threat that has been detected. It also allows you to create custom detections and automate responses based on specific conditions. However, when creating advanced hunting queries, care should be taken to ensure that critical threat information is not disclosed. Option A is incorrect because the SIEM integration is focused on sending collected data to a central location for analysis and not on providing detailed information about a specific threat. Option B is incorrect because the automatic response feature is used to configure automated actions that are taken when a specific event or condition is met and not to provide additional details about a detected threat. Option D is incorrect because the threat indicators feature aggregates threat intelligence data from various sources and integrate it into the protection features of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Still, it does not provide detailed information about a specific threat.
