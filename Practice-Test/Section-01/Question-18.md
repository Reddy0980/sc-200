## Explanation
Microsoft Defender for Identity can be integrated with other Microsoft tools to provide a comprehensive security solution. The first step in the integration process is to select the integration method, such as API integration or event forwarding. The Microsoft tool to be integrated, such as Azure Active Directory or Microsoft Cloud App Security, should be configured to allow the integration. The Defender for Identity connector should be configured to enable communication between the two systems. Finally, the integration settings should be configured to define how the data is shared between the systems.
