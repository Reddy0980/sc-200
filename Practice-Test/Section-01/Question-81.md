## Explanation
While automation rules can be used to create automated actions when specific conditions are met, and machine learning can analyze data to detect anomalies and create alerts, the paradigm for automating incident handling and response in Microsoft Sentinel is through the use of playbooks. Playbooks are pre-defined workflows that can automate complex tasks and help coordinate actions across multiple teams and technologies. They can be customized to fit the needs of specific workflows and incorporate a wide range of actions, including automated remediation steps, email notifications, and data query and enrichment. While automation rules and machine learning can enhance the broader SOAR strategy, playbooks are vital to automating incident response and reducing response time.
