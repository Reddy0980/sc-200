## Explanation
Microsoft Defender for Identity provides visibility into user authentication, device configurations, and application usage. The solution can identify anomalous behaviors and generate alerts by Analyzing the data collected from network and host sensors. Security analysts can investigate these alerts and take remediation actions to prevent attacks. For example, they can determine whether a user account has been compromised, a device has been infected with malware, or an application is being used for malicious purposes.
