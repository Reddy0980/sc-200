## Explanation
While creating a customized playbook may seem like a comprehensive solution, it can be time-consuming and may not be necessary. Relying solely on automation rules can also be too restrictive and may not account for all possible response scenarios. The recommended approach is to begin with pre-built playbooks available in Sentinel and customize them as needed to fit specific needs. This ensures a more efficient and effective automation process. The Bring Your ML feature focuses more on machine learning for threat detection than SOAR.
