## Explanation
Bookmarks in Microsoft Sentinel allow for tracking specific IOCs, such as IP addresses or file hashes, and can also include notes and links to related incidents or entities. While queries can also be saved for easier access, bookmarks serve a more specific purpose in threat hunting. Creating a visual representation of the threat landscape is not the primary purpose of bookmarks.
