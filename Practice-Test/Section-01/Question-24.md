In Microsoft 365 Defender, XDR leverages machine learning models to detect and respond to threats across endpoints, emails, and identities. Healthcare organizations can utilize XDR to identify anomalous behavior that could indicate a threat, such as unusual login patterns or data exfiltration attempts. Email notifications can be configured as a part of the response process, but the detection process is primarily automated.
