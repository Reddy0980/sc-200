## Explanation
When managing incidents in Sentinel, it's essential to save and export all logs related to the incident to preserve evidence for future use, compliance, or reporting. Saving only the relevant logs that confirm the incident may result in missing critical information or evidence that could be useful in future investigations. Saving only the logs that are relevant to the case and exporting them to a local location can also be problematic, as evidence may be lost if the local location is not secure or if it is not accessible by authorized personnel. Saving logs related to the incident in Sentinel's Case entity and exporting them to a remote location ensures that the evidence is stored securely and can be accessed by authorized users.
