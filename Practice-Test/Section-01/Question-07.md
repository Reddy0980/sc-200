## Explanation
 Automated investigation and remediation capabilities in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint enable organizations to automatically detect, investigate, and mitigate endpoint security threats. Specifically, the system can automatically investigate suspicious file activity on an endpoint device and quarantine any identified malware. Additionally, the system can automatically send email notifications to security administrators when suspicious file activity is detected, initiate a custom script or remediation action to prevent the execution of known malicious code and detect and block risk devices attempting to connect to the network. These automated actions help ensure endpoint device protection and reduce the burden on security administrators to investigate manually and remediate incidents.
