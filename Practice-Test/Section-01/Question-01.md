## Explanation
 Ignoring alerts is not an effective method for incident mitigation. Instead, it is recommended to review each alert and respond accordingly manually. This will allow for a more thorough investigation and response to potential incidents. Additionally, configuring automated investigations to handle low-risk alerts can free up time for manual investigations of higher-risk alerts. Option D is incorrect because the severity rating of an alert does not necessarily determine the level of threat it poses to the organization.
