## Explanation
When a user account is compromised, Microsoft Defender for Identity generates an alert with incident details. The first step in investigating a compromised account is to review the alert to understand the nature and scope of the threat. Once the severity of the threat has been determined, the security analyst should identify the source of the threat, which may involve analyzing network and host data. After the source of the threat has been identified, the security analyst should reset the account password to prevent further unauthorized access. Finally, the security analyst should take remediation actions to address the underlying security issue and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
