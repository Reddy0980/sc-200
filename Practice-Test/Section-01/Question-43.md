## Explanation
Bookmarks are a valuable tool in Microsoft Sentinel for marking essential search queries and returning to them later. With the ability to create multiple bookmarks, users can organize their search results and quickly navigate to crucial details. Unlike alerts, bookmarks do not automatically trigger notifications. Bookmarks help document investigations and share results with other Sentinel users. Real-time monitoring is not a feature of bookmarks.
