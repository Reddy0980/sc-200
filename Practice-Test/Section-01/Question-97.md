## Explanation
To create a workbook showing the top 10 sources of security events, you can use the Workbook Designer to create a new workbook and the query builder to create a custom query for the top security event sources. The pre-built Top Security Event Sources workbook may not show the specific information you need, and the Microsoft Power BI integration is not designed explicitly for creating Sentinel workbooks.
