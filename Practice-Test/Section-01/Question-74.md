## Explanation
The best approach to classify data in Microsoft Sentinel based on the sensitivity of the data is to create a custom normalization parser in Azure Sentinel. A normalization parser helps identify the type of data being ingested and performs a normalization process to create a standard data format that can be used for further processing. A custom normalization parser can be created to classify data based on the sensitivity of the data. Built-in normalization parsers in Azure Sentinel may not be sufficient to classify data based on the sensitivity of the data. Content packs in Azure Sentinel provide pre-built dashboards but do not help in data classification. Using a third-party tool may not be necessary, as Azure Sentinel provides tools to accomplish data classification.
