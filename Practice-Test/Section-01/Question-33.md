## Explanation
To connect Azure assets to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, organizations should consider configuring asset inventory to identify potential vulnerabilities and threats. Auto-provisioning can be used to efficiently deploy the Microsoft Monitoring Agent to all Azure VMs within an enterprise-scale solution. However, in cases where the organization wants to monitor configurations and runtime activity of a single VM, manual log analytics agent provisioning may be required. When configuring data sources for Azure Defender, the organization should prioritize Azure resources running critical workloads or susceptible to frequent cyberattacks. This approach will help the organization to ensure that its most valuable assets are protected against cyber threats.
