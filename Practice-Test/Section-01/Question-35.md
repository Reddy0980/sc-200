## Explanation
Organizations can leverage different paradigms to connect non-Azure resources to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, depending on their specific needs and constraints. Azure Arc-enabled servers offer consistent security monitoring and management across various machines, regardless of their location and environment. Azure Defender for Servers provides a seamless way to deploy a lightweight agent that enables non-Azure resources to access Microsoft Defender for Cloud's threat detection and response capabilities. Finally, Azure Sentinel provides a centralized view of the security posture of all connected machines, allowing organizations to detect potential risks and respond to ongoing or incoming attacks. While all three paradigms are relevant for addressing the compatibility concerns of non-Azure machines, they each offer different features and benefits that organizations should carefully evaluate.
