## Explanation
Option A is not ideal since hiring more employees is not the best approach to tackle incidents when technology can optimize investigating and responding to incidents more efficiently. Option C is incorrect because ignoring country privacy regulations can lead to legal consequences that could harm the company's reputation. Option D is not an option, as the current system is already set and performing as intended. Therefore, configuring Microsoft 365 Defender portal and using threat analytics to analyze reports helps the security team quickly identify threats and mitigate them effectively.
