## Explanation
 The Suspicious sign-in activity analytics rule is best suited for detecting and preventing fraud attempts in a retail company. This rule analyzes sign-in activity and can detect abnormal signs, such as sign-ins from unfamiliar locations or unusual times of the day. An unusual IP address is designed to detect sign-ins from unusual or unfamiliar IP addresses. Impossible travel is designed to detect sign-ins that would be impossible for a user to perform in the given time frame. A brute-force attack is designed to detect attempts to guess or crack passwords by repeated attempts. While these analytics rules may be useful in cybersecurity, only Suspicious sign-in activity is specifically designed to detect and prevent fraud attempts in a retail company.
