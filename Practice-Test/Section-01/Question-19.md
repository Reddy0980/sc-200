## Explanation
XDR is a security solution that enables organizations to monitor and detect threats across multiple endpoints, identities, and cloud applications. To manage XDR in Microsoft 365 Defender, organizations should first monitor and detect threats across their environment. They should then identify security gaps and prioritize remediation efforts to strengthen their security posture. When security incidents occur, they should investigate and respond to them promptly to minimize the impact. Finally, they should integrate Microsoft 365 Defender with other security tools and services to streamline their security operations.
