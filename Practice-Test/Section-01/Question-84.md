## Explanation
You can configure automation rules to trigger automatic incident handling. The rules can be created based on severity, specific alerts or incidents, time, etc. These rules can automatically run playbooks that automate incident management tasks. Playbooks are automated response procedures triggered by automation rules to perform specific tasks in response to incidents. Microsoft Sentinel offers a range of pre-built playbooks, and you can also create your custom playbook to automate specific tasks per your organization's needs. Microsoft Sentinel offers to Bring Your Machine Learning (BYOML) capabilities, allowing users to upload and manage their machine learning models. These models can identify anomalous behaviour and automatically trigger actions defined in the automation rules.
