## Explanation
The Update analytics rule templates feature allows security teams to manage analytics rule templates efficiently by reviewing and updating them regularly. This feature enables teams to create a new version of the rule template, which can be published and used in new analytics rules. Export and Import analytics rule templates allow security teams to move analytics rules between Azure Sentinel instances. Still, they do not provide the ability to manage rule templates efficiently. The Manage analytics rule templates feature is used to view and edit existing rule templates, but does not allow updating them.
